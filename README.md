🏪 Grocery Store Management System – SQL Project
🌟 Project Overview

This project simulates a Grocery Store Management System where multiple real-world business entities interact: suppliers, customers, employees, products, and orders. The system is built using SQL, focusing on designing a well-structured relational database, managing data integrity, and extracting valuable business insights through complex queries.

🧱 Database Schema Structure

The database consists of 7 core tables designed with clear relationships:

Table Name	Description
supplier	Stores supplier details providing products.
categories	Different product categories (e.g., Beverages, Snacks).
employees	Employee records handling customer orders.
customers	Customer details placing orders.
products	Product details, including price, supplier, and category info.
orders	Customer orders linked to employees.
order_details	Line-item details for each order, capturing product quantity and pricing.
✅ Key Features:

Primary keys auto-increment for easier data handling.

Foreign Key constraints with ON UPDATE CASCADE / ON DELETE CASCADE for referential integrity.

Consistent schema to support realistic data operations.

🎯 Business Problem Solving Goals

The project demonstrates real-world use cases of data management in the retail/grocery domain by addressing these areas:

1️⃣ Customer Insights:

Number of unique customers placing orders.

Top customers by total purchase amount.

Average and total purchases per customer.

2️⃣ Product Performance:

Product count per category.

Average price per category.

Products with highest total sales volume.

Revenue generated by each product.

3️⃣ Sales & Order Trends:

Total number of orders placed.

Average order value.

Peak order dates.

Monthly revenue trends.

Weekday vs. weekend order analysis.

4️⃣ Supplier Contributions:

Number of suppliers.

Supplier providing the most products.

Supplier revenue contribution.

5️⃣ Employee Performance:

Number of employees processing orders.

Employees handling the most orders.

Sales value by employee.

6️⃣ Order-Level Insights:

Relationship between ordered quantity and total price.

Unit price variation across products and orders.

⚡ Technologies & Concepts Applied

SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) for table creation.

SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Advanced querying techniques:

Multi-table JOINs (INNER, LEFT).

Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MAX().

Subqueries.

GROUP BY and HAVING.

Date-based filtering & formatting.

Data consistency and normalization practices.

Referential integrity using FOREIGN KEY constraints.

✅ Challenges Faced

Designing meaningful relationships between multiple tables.

Managing VARCHAR-based date fields for time-series analysis.

Dealing with large datasets and ensuring efficient query performance.

Crafting complex aggregations across joined tables.

Maintaining data consistency during data import (especially ensuring column name matches).
